{"name":"About","tagline":"","body":"  \r\nThanks for visiting my website. I will be using this to aggregate some of my work and thoughts regarding mechanical design. Over five semesters of my studies at USC, I worked in teams to complete five projects spanning widespread industries on designs consisting of a remotely-controlled surveillance robot, microprocessor cooling system, hybrid automobile, ergonomic computer input system, and an object oriented application that creates a “shopping list” of computer parts for the user to build a customized desktop.\r\n\r\n## Remotely-Controlled Surveillance Robot\r\n\r\nThis project was completed as the capstone of my first class in design. Once our group identified the essential functions needed to be carried out by the robot, I created the design for the function “to hold” and “to move” the robot’s position. Our customer (class’ professor) required the robot to ascend sixty feet up a nonporous wall perpendicular to the earth’s surface. I created the proposed design with governing engineering principles shown from figures 22 to 28.  \r\n[Remotely Controlled Surveillance Robot.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNQ1RSOHNmVWdidVU/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Microprocessor Cooler \r\n\r\nAs our first of two senior design projects, a fellow ME student and I tested the feasibility of using a thermoelectric module to maintain an Intel Pentium4 microproccesor’s temperature, notorious for its tendency to overheat. My lab partner conveniently owned a desktop that housed this beastly piece of technology, so we used his familiarity as a means to tune processor loading parameters. I created the timelines by breaking the project into a testing and implementation phase and naturally was responsible for generating the biweekly reports. Additionally, this was an excellent opportunity to learn LabView, so I put together the program that took real time readings of temperature and calculated voltage output.  \r\n[Microprocessor Cooler.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNTEFETWwycUFHR1E/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Hybrid Automobile\r\n\r\nPer USC’s ME curriculum standards, the second of two senior design projects was completed in a class setting. Using lecture material and the guidelines of our final product—a design as opposed to an actual, working proof of concept like the microprocessor cooler—I created the design for a hybrid car. To further encourage the development of teamwork skills, the project was done twice: first individually then later our group collectively designed a second. Hybrid cars were completely new to me, so I decided to create a series, an efficient but simple, design. My team created a dual hybrid design, which affords the generally high mileage of series and the high acceleration of parallel at the tradeoff of increased complexity and build cost.  \r\n[Group J Dual Hybrid Report.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNWkVJeFJTYjd5aHM/edit?usp=sharing)  \r\n[Series Hybrid Report.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNdGtGYVJmU05QcGc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Ergonomic Computer Input System\r\n\r\nThe project was completed in a class whose focus was to change our approach to designing artifacts. The methodology, in general, derived the customer’s product’s functions (the how) and satisfy them through mechanical means (the what) by resolving seemingly contradicting requirements of the customer. The mechanical means our group decided on was based on the abstract contradiction that we sought to make a device ergonomic (a positive quality of varying degrees) by reducing repeated stress input (a negative) through constant motion that would encourage blood flow. Finding the ideal frequency of body motion--too low and not enough blood flow is induced, too high and another form of RSI might result--could be approached through an empirical, biologically tested means or a mechanical one. Because biology was not our field of expertise, or the class’, we went with the latter approach.  \r\n[Input Control System Slides.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNY3hMblpQR0Q1U0U/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Desktop Parts Shopping List Builder\r\n\r\nFor a new class in our mechanical engineering department, I worked with a team to develop a Java application to build a desktop based on a survey the user fills out. The beauty of the application is that it is scalable in many senses, one being that ideally an unlimited number of people could create their own desktop from a list of computer parts that were generated in a standardized, quantifiable process; naturally this was also a potential weakness and was addressed to create the best program possible. The GUI I created gathered the user’s price range and desktop-usage as well and displayed three optimal setups outputted in terms of price, picture, and part name as shown in figure 10. Because of the serial processing nature of Java, I also worked on a high level with the members creating the algorithm that chose the parts to create the desktop system.  \r\n[Computer Parts Shopping List Builder Final Report.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0k5NDyZTSPNUTd1Z0ZZeGM3UXM/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
